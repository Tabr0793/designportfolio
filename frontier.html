          <div class="h2" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.9em;margin-bottom:50px;">Frontier Airlines, is one of the leading ultra low-cost carrier airlines in the US, focused on minimizing operation costs to pass those savings onto customers. With indisputable data proving technology can significantly reduce labor costs and drive customer loyalty, Frontier Airlines decided it was time to invest in a new website and mobile app to help differentiate their services and drive incremental growth.

    <h3 class="h1" style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:20px;">My Role</h3>
    <div class="h2" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.7em;">As UX Designer, I was hired to design Frontier’s new website alongside one other UX Designer.  In this position I focused on user research and business strategy to generate effective design solutions that would drive market sales and customer loyalty.<br></br>
In October, 2019 I became Lead UX Designer on Frontier’s new mobile app project.  In this role I lead a team of UX and UI designers from Budapest.  My main goal was to help them stay on track with business and brand initiatives.<br></br><mark> Both projects are on hold because of COVID-19.</mark>

      <div class="overview" data-ix="reveal-bar-over" id="overview">
        <h3 class="h1"style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:20px;">The Challenge</h3>
        <div class="h2" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.7em;">In order to offer low-cost airfare to all of its customers,  Frontier offers a ‘no-frills’ service that many customers don’t expect.  Because of this, travelers reported feeling ill prepared when they get to the airport.  In addition, lean team structures encourage long wait times and a lack of customer support, causing customers to feel disconnected which adds to their stress.  As a consequence of these business initiatives, Frontier continues to see rising abandonment rates, low customer loyalty, and a brand identity in need of repair.

      </div>
        <div class="overview" data-ix="reveal-bar-over" id="overview">
          <h3 class="h1"style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:20px;">The Goal</h3>
          <div class="h2" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.7em;">The objective was to reimagine the way Frontier interacts with its travelers across all platforms.  From planning, booking, on board, at destination and during the post trip experience, we wanted the traveler to feel inspired, organized, and at ease during every point in their travel cycle. This meant exploring new ways to streamline ticket sales, encourage ancillary item purchases, aid in customer service, improve customer loyalty programs, and boost brand perception.

          <h3 class="h1"style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:20px;">Process</h3>
          <div class="h2" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.7em;margin-bottom:50px;">Being such a large project, we needed to develop a foundational understanding of what the platforms needed to accomplish for it to be a success.  After lots of conversations with company leaders, and this use of many discovery methods (e.g., user surveys, personas, competitive analysis and live website analysis) we were able to construct a list that would help us stay on course.

      <br></br>The platform must:
<ul>
      <li>Convey the company’s brand and identity </li>
      <li>Inspire and educate curious potential travelers to make a purchase</li>
      <li>Direct customers looking to make a purchase to the correct user flow (and/or answer their questions) </li>
      <li>Direct customers who have already made a purchase to the information or actions they need (checking in, checking flight status, etc.). </li>
</ul>

        <div class="overview" data-ix="reveal-bar-over" id="overview">
          <h3 class="h1" style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:20px;">Agile Approach</h3>
          <div class="h2" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.7em;">Navigation on an airline platform is not a linear process so neither was our approach.  User flows and roadmapping helped us break up user paths to narrow our scope.

            <ul style="list-style: none">
                  <br><li><b>Discover</b><br>
                  A major concern when designing the website was user fatigue and information overload.  During the discovery phase, we focus heavily on competitive analysis to uncover effective ways to simplify designs and user flows so customers could purchase tickets faster and spend less time looking for needed information.</li>
                  <br><li><b>Define</b><br>To define the scope, we’d use user stories, and user flows to write out a list of minimum viable requirements. This portion of the process frequently took extra time because company executives struggled with change.  In order to combat objections, we’d used research to back up our stance.  Despite our best efforts, sometimes we would lose the battle, but we did get to celebrate some wins!</li>
                  <br><li><b>Design</b><br>As soon as the scope was defined, we’d work on low-fidelity wireframes to present to company leaders and developers.  Once executives agreed with the approach and developers determined our ideas could be built on the backend, we would split up design responsibilities and use adobe XD to create high-fidelity wireframes.  All designs were made using a brand style guide for consistency.</li>
                  <br><li><b>Test</b><br>  All designs were user and AB tested before taking them to final review.</li>
                  <br><li><b>Deliver</b><br>All final designs went through many design iterations before final approval.  Once designs were approved by company leaders, we would set up meetings to go over design functions with our developers before handoff.  </li>
                </ul>
      </div>
        </div>



      <div class="overview" data-ix="reveal-bar-over" id="overview">
          <h3 class="h1" style="font-size:24px; margin-bottom:20px;" <a name="bottom" id="bottom">What I Learned at Frontier</a></h3>
            <div class="h2" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.7em;">Spending almost 2 years on projects that have been shut down due to COVID-19 is a huge bummer.  But I did walk away with some great experience and invaluable lessons.
              <ol><br></br>
                  <li><b>Push for the process</b><br>
                   Working with people that don't understand the UX process paired with time and business constraints can be frustrating and make it difficult to pursue the process.  Although it's important to help others understand that the process will help us reach the end goal, time can be of the essence.  Standing behind the “why” paired with an understanding for business goals and needs is the best way to stay on track.
                   <br></br>
                  <li><b> Presentation is key </b><br>
                    “As a designer: you have to realize that your job is to help other people realize their vision, not yours.”
                    As much as it's important to create something that is user friendly and functional, it's equally as important to be able to explain how you formulate your designs in a language your audience understands.  Listening to others needs and framing my design approach in a way that helped others feel heard proved to be very helpful during my design process at Frontier.  After all, the goal was not to design the perfect platform for me, it was to design something that would help others with their needs in mind.  The more I continued to understand my audience, the faster my approval process got.
                </li>
                <br></br>
                <li><b>STOP and listen.</b><br>
                 Meetings can get pretty tense, especially if people in the room would rather argue their point instead of listen to others.  By learning to listen more and argue less, I was able to gain respect from colleagues and act as a voice of reason.  This quality frequently helped me bridge the gap so we could agree on business and design decisions that would help us all reach the end goal.
               </li>
                 <br></br>
                <li><b> Just use pen and paper </b><br>
                  I used to create low fidelity wireframes on the computer because they looked more presentable.  However, I realised when I quickly mocked up wireframes in meetings without a computer, I wasn’t only having more fun but there was less attachment to my designs so I could throw them away and try again.  I’ve found that the pen and paper approach leaves me more room for creative freedom and helps me discover more variations on possible solutions.  Which saves me lots of time in the long run.</li>
                <br></br>
                <li><b>Mix it up for a fresh perspective</b><br>
                  "A person doesn't have to be a designer to have good ideas.  It takes a designer to recognize those good ideas and then apply them."<br>
                  The most frustrating part about being a designer is getting stuck on a problem.  A great way to get unstuck is by talking ideas through with others.  At Frontier, I found the best way to restimulate my creativity was by inviting others to inspire me.  I’d either spark up tableside conversations or invite a group to do an activity with me.  Whatever my tactic, I found interaction always helped me reframe my outlook and approach to designs with a fresh perspective.  As an added bonus, I noticed people loved being part of the discussion and took more interest in my projects when they felt like their opinion mattered.

                </li>
                  <br></br>
                <li><b> The little things are just as important as the bigger picture.</b><br>
                  Being the only UX designer in the later part of 2019 meant I was also solely responsible for the day to day upkeep of Frontier’s live digital platforms.  During this time I found myself falling behind on the projects I was hired to complete and I was frustrated I was being pulled away for design roles that did not interest me.  This is what I learned: No tasks are a waste of time, it's okay to ask for help, and it feels good to help with the little things because those little things can help others and the company in a bigger way than you realize.
                </li>
              </ol>

            <div class="h2" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.7em;">Not finishing what I started at Frontier due to COVID-19 was a tough pill for me to swallow but I feel lucky to have walked away with such incredible experience.  Working for Frontier taught me how to be a better teammate and leader.  It also taught me powerful tools that will help me balance business goals and engineering constraints as I unrelentingly advocate for the user in my next design roles to come.
